# Three gates, because "it compiled" is not the same as "it proved":
#   1. `lake build` succeeds.
#   2. No `sorry` / `admit` in the sources.
#   3. No theorem depends on `sorryAx` (the axiom a `sorry` introduces —
#      this catches a hole reached through any import, which a source
#      grep alone would miss).
