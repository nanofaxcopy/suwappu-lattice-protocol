"""
Relayer — cross-chain sealed key transport for the ETP bridge.

Wraps LTPProtocol.lattice() to produce a RelayPacket:
  - Seals the CEK + entity_id + commitment_ref to the L2 verifier's public key
  - Packages the sealed key with bridge routing metadata
  - The relayer itself is UNTRUSTED — it transports an opaque blob

Trust model:
  The relayer cannot read the CEK (ML-KEM encrypted), cannot forge the
  commitment (ML-DSA signed), and cannot redirect to a different recipient
  (sealed to a specific ML-KEM encapsulation key).

  When a SignerPolicy is provided, the relayer verifies that the relay
  operator is authorized before forwarding. Relay messages are wrapped
  in a SignedEnvelope for authenticated transport.

    Cross-chain relayer: seals a LatticeKey and packages it for transport.

    The relayer is intentionally minimal and untrusted.  It:
      1. Receives a BridgeCommitment + CEK from the L1Anchor
      2. Optionally verifies relay authorization via SignerPolicy
      3. Calls LTPProtocol.lattice() to seal the key to the L2 verifier
      4. Wraps in SignedEnvelope for authenticated transport
      5. Returns a RelayPacket containing the sealed key + routing metadata

    The sealed key is ~1.3KB — orders of magnitude smaller than the original
    bridge message + shards.  This is the ONLY data that crosses chains.
