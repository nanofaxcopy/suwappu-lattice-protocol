"""
Nonce tracker — per-sender monotonic nonce registry for replay protection.

Each (source_chain, sender) pair maintains a high-water mark.  A nonce is
valid iff it is strictly greater than the last processed nonce for that sender.

.. deprecated::
    For new code, prefer ``ltp.sequencing.SequenceTracker`` which adds
    chain binding, temporal expiry, and VK-fingerprint-based tracking.
    This class is retained for backward compatibility with existing bridge code.
