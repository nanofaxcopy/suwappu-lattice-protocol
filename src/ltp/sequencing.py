"""
Sequence tracker — per-signer monotonic sequencing with chain binding and expiry.

Replaces the simpler NonceTracker from bridge/nonce.py with richer semantics:
  - Per-signer (by VK fingerprint) monotonic sequence enforcement
  - Chain binding: receipts are rejected if target_chain_id doesn't match
  - Temporal expiry: receipts with past valid_until are rejected
  - Batch validation for efficient bulk processing
