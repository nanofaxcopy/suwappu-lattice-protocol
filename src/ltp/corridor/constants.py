# Paper §10.2 — constant on-chain commitment size.
#
# CAUTION: this figure is a paper-level approximation and matches NO actual
# field layout. The real envelope totals are:
#     ML-KEM-768:   1088 + 96 + 32 = 1216 B
#     ML-KEM-1024:  1568 + 96 + 32 = 1696 B
# Neither is 1,600. The 1,600 figure is the ML-KEM-**1024** ciphertext
# (1,568 B) plus the SHA3-256 root (32 B), i.e. it drops the 96-byte
# aggregate signature — and an earlier version of this comment additionally
# mislabeled that 1,568 B as the "ML-KEM-768 ciphertext". ML-KEM-768's
# ciphertext is 1,088 B (see `src/ltp/primitives.py::_REAL_KEM_CT`);
# 1,568 B is ML-KEM-1024 (Level 5).
#
# Consequences, both already documented in `envelope.py`:
#   - `OnChainCommitment.assert_strict_total()` is unsatisfiable for every
#     well-formed envelope; it is a forward-compat stub, not a live check.
#   - The invariant that actually holds is payload INDEPENDENCE, not this
#     specific number. That is machine-checked in `formal/lean/` (see
#     `Ltp/Commitment.lean`: `commitment_size_payload_independent` and
#     `strict_total_unsatisfiable`).
#
# Do not "fix" a field width to make this arithmetic work — the Lean proofs
# pin the widths and will fail. Changing the constant is a cross-repo wire
# decision shared with suwappu-dag/crates/suwappu-ltp.
