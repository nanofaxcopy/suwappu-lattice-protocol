"""
Portable Merkle proofs for the Lattice Transfer Protocol.

Self-contained proofs that can be verified without access to the full tree.
Designed for cross-chain verification and external auditor consumption.

A PortableMerkleProof contains everything needed for standalone verification:
  - The leaf hash and its position in the tree
  - The root hash and tree size
  - The audit path (sibling hashes) with direction flags
  - Tree type discriminator
