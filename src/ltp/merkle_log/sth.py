"""
Signed Tree Head (STH) for the Merkle log.

Each STH is a ML-DSA-65-signed snapshot of the log state, binding the operator's
identity to a specific (sequence, tree_size, root_hash) triple.

STHs serve two critical functions:
  1. Tamper detection: any modification to log history changes root_hash,
     which invalidates the ML-DSA signature covering it.
  2. Equivocation detection: two valid STHs with the same sequence number
     but different root hashes are cryptographic proof that the operator
     presented inconsistent views of the log (a fork).  The pair of STHs
     constitutes a self-contained, unforgeable evidence bundle.

Signable payload (canonical byte encoding):
  sequence (8 bytes, big-endian uint64)
  || tree_size (8 bytes, big-endian uint64)
  || timestamp (8 bytes, IEEE 754 double big-endian)
  || root_hash (32 bytes, BLAKE2b-256)

The timestamp is included so STHs are not replayable across time even if an
operator signs the same tree state twice.
