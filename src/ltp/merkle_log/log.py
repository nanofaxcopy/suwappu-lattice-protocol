"""
MerkleLog — high-level CT-style append-only commitment log.

Wraps MerkleTree with operator signing (STH publication), inclusion proof
generation, and equivocation detection.  This is the reference implementation
of the LTP §5.1.4 recommended deployment: a CT-style multi-operator Merkle log.

Minimum conformance contract (per whitepaper §5.1.4):
  MUST  append records to an append-only BLAKE2b-256 Merkle tree
  MUST  publish ML-DSA-65 Signed Tree Heads (STHs)
  MUST  produce O(log N) inclusion proofs for any committed record
  MUST  detect operator equivocation via detect_equivocation()
  SHOULD exchange STHs with at least one independent operator

Single-operator usage (sufficient for testing and private deployments):
  log = MerkleLog(operator_vk, operator_sk)
  idx = log.append(record_bytes)
  sth = log.publish_sth()
  proof = log.inclusion_proof(idx)
  assert proof.verify(record_bytes, sth.root_hash)

Multi-operator gossip (production):
  Each operator runs its own MerkleLog instance.  Participants exchange STHs
  and call detect_equivocation(sth_a, sth_b) when they receive a new STH.
  Any equivocation is cryptographic proof of operator misbehavior, no further
  investigation needed.
