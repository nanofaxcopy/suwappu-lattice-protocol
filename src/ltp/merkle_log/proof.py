"""
Inclusion proof for the Merkle log.

An InclusionProof lets a verifier confirm that a specific record exists at a
given position in the log, without holding any other records.  It contains
only the audit path (O(log N) sibling hashes) needed to reconstruct the root.

Verification algorithm:
  1. Compute leaf_hash = H(0x00 || data)  — RFC 6962 domain-separated leaf
  2. Walk the audit_path from leaf level to root, applying _verify_inclusion()
  3. Compare the reconstructed root against the claimed_root (from a verified STH)
  4. If they match, the record is proven to be in the log

The verifier must independently obtain a trusted root (e.g., from a verified STH
published by a log operator).  The proof itself is not self-authenticating —
it proves membership relative to a root, not that the root is honest.
