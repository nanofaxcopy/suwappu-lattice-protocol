"""
Per-entity anchor lifecycle tracker.

Tracks the status of on-chain anchor submissions from PENDING through
FINALIZED (or FAILED).  Thread-safe — all mutations are protected by
a threading.Lock.

Design decision: in-memory only.  The on-chain contract is the source of
truth; after restart the AnchorVerifier can re-derive status.
Persistence deferred to a future release.
