# Code Improvement Recommendations

> **Status: COMPLETED** — All 12 recommendations addressed. Retained for historical reference.

Analysis of the Entanglement Transfer Protocol codebase — all 821 tests passing.

## 1. Global Mutable State in PoC Simulation Tables

**Files:** `src/ltp/primitives.py:252-253`, `src/ltp/keypair.py:94`, `src/ltp/shards.py:42`

**Issue:** `MLDSA._PoC_sig_table`, `MLDSA._PoC_sk_to_vk`, `SealedBox._PoC_encaps_table`, and `ShardEncryptor._issued_ceks` are class-level mutable dictionaries/sets that persist across test runs and accumulate entries forever. This causes:

- **Memory leak:** Every sign/seal/generate_cek call adds to these dicts with no eviction. In a long-running process or repeated test runs, this grows unboundedly.
- **Test pollution:** The `scope="session"` keypair fixtures interact with these global tables across tests. If test ordering changes, previously-impossible side effects could emerge.
- **Thread-unsafety:** Multiple threads using `LTPProtocol` concurrently would race on these shared dicts.

**Recommendations:**
- Add a `clear_poc_state()` helper (or pytest fixture) that resets all PoC lookup tables between test modules.
- Consider using `WeakValueDictionary` or adding an upper-bound eviction policy.
- Document in `CLAUDE.md` or a developer guide that these tables are PoC artifacts to be removed when real ML-KEM/ML-DSA implementations are integrated.

## 2. `assert` Used for Input Validation (Not Just Internal Invariants)

**Files:** `src/ltp/primitives.py:190,211-212,287,311`, `src/ltp/erasure.py:69,89-90,138,166`

**Issue:** Several places use `assert` to validate arguments from callers:

```python
assert len(ek) == cls.EK_SIZE, ...   # primitives.py:190
assert n > k > 0, ...                # erasure.py:89
assert len(shards) >= k, ...         # erasure.py:166
```

When Python runs with `-O` (optimized mode), all `assert` statements are stripped, silently disabling these validations. This is particularly dangerous for the cryptographic primitives — passing a wrong-sized key would silently produce incorrect results.

**Recommendation:** Replace `assert` with explicit `if ... raise ValueError(...)` for all public API boundaries. Keep `assert` only for internal invariants that should never fire (e.g., `assert pivot is not None` in Gaussian elimination).

## 3. Sender Key Registry Is Protocol-Instance-Scoped (Fragile)

**File:** `src/ltp/protocol.py:46-47,239-241`

**Issue:** `LTPProtocol._sender_keypairs` stores sender keypairs registered during `commit()` and looks them up during `materialize()`. This means:

- If a receiver uses a **different** `LTPProtocol` instance than the one that committed, `materialize()` fails at step 4 with "Sender not found in registry" — even though the commitment is perfectly valid.
- There is no external key registry or public key infrastructure; the protocol instance is acting as both the PKI and the protocol orchestrator.

**Recommendation:** Decouple key distribution from protocol orchestration. Options:
- Accept a `sender_vk_registry: dict[str, bytes]` at init or per-materialize.
- Store `sender_vk` directly in the `CommitmentRecord` (it's already in the log via `sender_id`).
- Add a separate `KeyRegistry` class that can be shared between protocol instances.

## 4. `__main__.py` Demo Is Too Long and Mixes Concerns

**File:** `src/ltp/__main__.py` (807 lines)

**Issue:** The demo file is a single 800+ line function (`demo()`) that combines:
- Protocol demonstration
- Security testing
- Theorem validation (TSEC, SINT, IMM)
- Trust model verification
- Storage proof strengthening
- Correlated failure analysis

This makes it hard to maintain, test individually, or reuse sections.

**Recommendations:**
- Break `demo()` into focused functions: `demo_transfers()`, `demo_security()`, `demo_shard_integrity()`, `demo_threshold_secrecy()`, etc.
- Consider moving the theorem validations to the test suite entirely (they already exist in `test_theorems.py`), keeping `__main__.py` as a concise user-facing demo.

---

## 5. Missing `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` — No Installable Package

**Issue:** The project has no `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg`. This means:
- `pip install -e .` doesn't work.
- Tests rely on `PYTHONPATH=.` or `sys.path` manipulation.
- Dependencies aren't declared (no `requirements.txt` either).
- No entry point for `python -m ltp` is formally declared.

**Recommendation:** Add a minimal `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68"]
build-backend = "setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend"

[project]
name = "ltp"
version = "0.3.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = ["pytest>=7"]
```

---

## 6. `__pycache__` Directories Are Tracked in Git

**Issue:** Multiple `__pycache__/` directories with `.pyc` files are present in the repository (visible in `src/ltp/__pycache__/` and `src/merkle_log/__pycache__/`). These are build artifacts that should never be committed.

**Recommendation:** Add a `.gitignore` with at minimum:
```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
```
Then remove the tracked cache files:
```bash
git rm -r --cached src/ltp/__pycache__ src/merkle_log/__pycache__
```

---

## 7. Erasure Coding Performance (O(n*k*chunk_size) Per Encode/Decode)

**File:** `src/ltp/erasure.py:99-110, 175-183`

**Issue:** The encode/decode loops are triple-nested Python loops over every byte position, every shard, and every data chunk. For the 100KB test payload:
- `chunk_size` ≈ 25,008
- Encode: 8 * 4 * 25,008 = ~800K GF(256) multiplications in pure Python
- Decode: similar with matrix inversion overhead

This is fine for a PoC but would be a bottleneck at scale.

**Recommendation:** Document this as a known PoC limitation. For production, the code already suggests `zfec` or `liberasurecode`. Consider adding a feature flag or environment variable to swap in an optimized backend when available.

---

## 8. `CommitmentNetwork._placement()` Has Weak Shard Distribution

**File:** `src/ltp/commitment.py:312-328`

**Issue:** The placement algorithm uses `(h + r * 7) % len(nodes)` for replica selection. The fixed stride of 7 means:
- With 6 nodes, the stride is equivalent to stride-1 (7 % 6 = 1), giving consecutive node selection.
- Replicas are not guaranteed to land in different regions. The `check_cross_region_placement()` method exists to verify this but doesn't enforce it.

**Recommendation:**
- Use a placement algorithm that explicitly enforces cross-region diversity (e.g., pick one node per region first, then fill replicas).
- Or use consistent hashing with virtual nodes weighted by region.

---

## 9. `CommitmentLog` Uses Linear Scan for `get_inclusion_proof()`

**File:** `src/ltp/commitment.py:258-259`

**Issue:** `get_inclusion_proof()` calls `self._chain.index(entity_id)` which is O(N) linear scan. For a log with many entries, this could become slow.

**Recommendation:** Add a `_chain_index: dict[str, int]` mapping for O(1) lookups. This is a simple optimization:
```python
def append(self, record):
    ...
    self._chain_index[record.entity_id] = len(self._chain) - 1
```

---

## 10. No Logging Framework — Uses `print()` Throughout

**File:** `src/ltp/protocol.py` (30+ print statements)

**Issue:** All protocol output uses `print()` directly. This means:
- No way to suppress output in production or tests
- No log levels (debug vs. info vs. warning)
- Test output is noisy (every test run prints pages of protocol trace)

**Recommendation:** Replace `print()` calls with Python's `logging` module:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("[COMMIT] Entity ID: %s...", entity_id[:16])
```
This lets users control verbosity via `logging.basicConfig(level=...)`.

---

## 11. Type Annotations Missing on Some Function Parameters

**Files:** Various

**Issue:** Several function signatures use `None` as default without `Optional` typing:
- `protocol.py:54-55`: `n: int = None, k: int = None` — should be `Optional[int] = None`
- `protocol.py:143`: `access_policy: dict = None` — should be `Optional[dict] = None`

**Recommendation:** Use `Optional[T]` (or `T | None` for Python 3.10+) for all nullable parameters. This helps type checkers like mypy catch bugs.

---

## 12. `fetch_encrypted_shards` Stops at k Instead of Fetching All n

**File:** `src/ltp/commitment.py:361-362`

**Issue:** `fetch_encrypted_shards()` takes both `n` and `k` but the early-exit at line 362 (`if len(fetched) >= k: break`) means it stops as soon as it has `k` shards. However, the caller in `protocol.py:257` passes `n` for both parameters (`fetch_encrypted_shards(key.entity_id, n, n)`), working around this.

The comment at line 253 says "fetch all n shards so AEAD can reject bad ones" but the API semantics are confusing — the `k` parameter controls the early exit, not the minimum for reconstruction.

**Recommendation:** Rename the parameter to clarify intent (e.g., `max_fetch` instead of `k`), or always fetch all `n` and let the caller decide how many to use.
